Non-Linearly Separable Boolean Function:
The aim of this work to find the number of non linearly with various input out of the total functions 2^(2^2). The problem can be stated in this way; in n-dimension, how many Boolean function are there such that the convex hulls of two disjoint sets will not intersect? Here single-layer-perceptron has been used to identify the number of Boolean function with 2, 3 & 4 input. Due to the lack of resource for computation, it was not possible to generate data programmatically.
Now question is there; can we formulate the number of linearly separable Boolean functions for n- dimension?
For 2 dim, we get 16 function (14 are linearly separable).
For 3 dim, we get 256 function (104 are linearly separable).
For 4 dim, we get 65536 function (1882 are linearly separable).
The all above data has been found programmatically. But no formulation is done so far.

To generate the data and the analysis the value against the variable input_space should be changed. After any alteration made, press 'Restart and Run All' in order to run the code.
In 3-D system, if output is '1', it is marked as orange & '0' with blue.
In 2-D system, if output is '1', it is marked as yellow & '0' with blue.
