The problem can be stated in this way; in n-dimension, how many Boolean function are there such that the convex hulls of two disjoint sets will not intersect? Here single-layer-perceptron has been used to identify the number of Boolean function with 2, 3 & 4 input. Due to the lack of resource for computation, it was not possible to generate data programmatically.\n","\n","#### Now question is there; can we formulate the number of linearly separable Boolean functions for n- dimension?\n","\n","#### For 2 dim, we get 16 function (14 are linearly separable).\n","#### For 3 dim, we get 256 function (104 are linearly separable).\n","#### For 4 dim, we get 65536 function (1882 are linearly separable).\n","\n","#### The all above data has been found programmatically. But no formulation is done so far.\n","\n","\n","More Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability\n","\n","## To generate the data and the analysis the value against the variable input_space should be changed.
